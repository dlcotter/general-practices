Running Hail on Dataproc

Create a cluster as described in the "Dataproc setup"

12/2/22 - Just before I left for a week off, I started organizing my notes on running Dataproc, Vertex AI, Hail, etc. into a hierarchical organization, with notebooks for each GCP technology and individual documents for each procedure. The idea was that a more complex walkthrough – one that integrated several of these technologies – would be able to point to the documentation for the invididual steps in the process, with branching logic, i.e. something like "if you need to clone a Github repo, see this document; if you need to retrieve something from Storage, see this other document; if you don't need either of those, please continue." This way, the amount of redundant documentation in complex walkthroughs could be kept to a minimum.

**The next steps in this process are to do a complete walkthrough of getting Jina's burden testing notebook running on Dataproc in a JupyterLab notebook and documenting the process as described above, then adding these documents to the "general practices" repo.**
