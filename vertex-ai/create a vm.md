5. From the menu at the top, click New Notebook and choose a basic programming environment (Python, R, etc.). In the dialog that opens, give the notebook a unique name and pick an appropriate region and zone. Click "Advanced Options" to choose operating system, machine type, disk size, memory size, etc. I used us-west1-b, Ubuntu 20.04, and an n1-highmem-4 machine, for example.
6. Once created, click **OPEN JUPYTERLAB** next to the notebook.
7. Update the system by running:
	```
	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
