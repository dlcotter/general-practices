# Using GitHub for Information Management

## Handling Different Types of Information

Starting January 2023, we will use GitHub as the primary mode for tracking and storing information (knowledge, methods, code, results) relevant to the VA Big Data Genomics group.

All **executables** such as code and computational notebooks should be saved in files and committed to a GitHub repository that belongs to the VA Big Data Genomics organization.

**Results** should be generated by code and stored in the context of the methods that generated them, such as in a computational (Jupyter) notebook.

**Methods** that cannot be performed by a computer, such as standard practices or general problem solving techniques should be stored in markdown files and similarly committed.

In most cases, new files should be committed to a repository via a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) so that they can be reviewed for quality and sensitive information.

**Knowledge** relating to a particular method such as a code block should be as close to the method as possible. In a computational notebook, this may be in a text block next to the code block. For a script or program, it can be added as a comment.

Problem solving techniques and **knowledge** relating to a particular issue should be tracked as a [GitHub Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

Project planning and management should be done by organizing Issues into [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/features/issues).

## What Gets Measured Gets Managed

To reduce loss of knowledge, practice consistently adding information to GitHub repositories. Contributions can be visualized using the contributions calendar on your [GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile). We are looking for lots of green dots, so prioritize frequent small contributions rather than infrequent big ones.

Make sure to enable "Private contributions" in the "Contribution settings" so that your contributions to private repositories are reflected in the contribution calendar.
